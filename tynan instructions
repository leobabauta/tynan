1. Create a new directory in the htdocs folder and call it 'trips'. Create a new git repo there. Now you can go to http://localhost/trips/  to access it, and the whole directory will be put in github.

2. Create a trips class that corresponds with the trips table you made in the database. It should also have __construct save and load methods. You should be able to do a lot of copy/pasting/editing to make this happen.

Ganbatte!
